- Active WYM stakeholder accounts earn a weekly reward.
- WYM stakeholders are able to vote for Producers.

### MEC is earned by network contributors, and is consumed to utilize network features.

- 1 Billion MEC issuance per year, with no initial supply.
- 25% of MEC issuance directed to content rewards, distributed according to stake weighted votes, views, shares and comments.
- 20% of MEC issuance directed to holders of WYM Cryptoequity when they are active on the network.
- 20% of MEC issuance is directed to Block Producers, which are elected by stakeholders, and create proofs of work.

# Consensus Model:

## Hybrid between Delegated Proof of Stake and Proof of Work.

### Block producers are seleted by stake weighted votes.
- The top 50 elected voting producers particpate in each round of block production.
- 10 Additional random producers are selected each round proportionally to the votes received.
- Producer voting uses a ranked list, according to preference order.

### Block Producers are also selected by proof of work output.
- The top 50 Miners participate in each round of block production.
- 10 Additional random miners are selected each round, proportionally to their mining output.
- [X11 Mining algorithm](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/x11-algorithm-explained/) is used, with a 10 minute target time for proofs.

### Block rewards are distributed to Producing nodes:
- 40%: Base block reward to individual producer.
- 15%: Proof of work reward on each proof broadcast.
- 15%: Proof of Activity for each producer voted as rank 1 when claiming activity rewards.
- 15%: Proof of transaction stake, based on transactions included in blocks.
- 15%: Block Validatio reward, for commiting stake on incoming blocks.
